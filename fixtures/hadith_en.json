When it was night, Abu Ad-Dardā' got up to offer (voluntary) night prayer, but Salmān told him to sleep and Abu Ad-Dardā' slept. After sometime, Abu Ad-Dardā' again got up to pray but Salmān told him to sleep. When it was the last hours of the night, Salmān told him to get up then, and both of them offered the prayer. Salmān told Abu Ad-Dardā': \"Your Lord has a right on you, your own self has a right on you, and your family has a right on you, so give everyone their due rights.\" Abu Ad-Dardā' came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and narrated the whole story. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Salmān has spoken the truth.\""
