Then the people began to talk about the people who would be admitted to Paradise without Judgment and without (suffering) any torment. Some of them said: ‘They may be those who (have had the good fortune of living) in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).’ And some of them said: ‘Perhaps they are those who were born in Islam and did not associate anything with Allah.’ Some people mentioned other things. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came out before them and said: ‘What was that which you were talking about?’ They informed him of it. He said: ‘They are those persons who neither ask others to do Ruqyah for them, nor do they cauterize, and they rely upon their Lord.’ Upon this, ‘Ukkāshah ibn Mihsan stood up and said: ‘Supplicate Allah for me that He should make me one among them.’ Upon this, he said: ‘You are one among them.’ Then another man stood up and said: ‘Supplicate Allah that He should make me one among them.’ Upon this, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Ukkāshah has preceded you.'\"",

(I swear) by the One in Whose hand the soul of Muhammad is! The foul smell that emanates from the mouth of the fasting person is more pleasant in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. The fasting person has two (moments of) joy: one when he breaks his fast, as he feels happy, and the other when he meets his lord, he is happy with his fast.\"\nThis is the wording of Al-Bukhāri's narration.\nIn another version by Al-Bukhāri: \"He leaves his food, drink, and sexual desire for My sake. Fasting is for me, and I will reward it, and a single good deed is worth ten.\"\nAccording to the narration of Muslim: \"Every action of the son of Adam is multiplied, and a single good deed is worth ten till seven hundred times. Allah, the Exalted, says: '(This is so) except for fasting, for indeed it is for Me, and I will reward it. He leaves his desires and food for My sake.' For the fasting person, there are two moments of joy; a moment of joy when he breaks his fast, and a moment of joy when he meets his lord. Verily, the unpleasant smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is more fragrant with Allah than the smell of musk.\"",

A man from the Ansār and I chased one of their men, and when we attacked him he said \"there is no god but Allah\". The Ansāri man held back from him but I stabbed him with my spear until I killed him. When we arrived in Madīnah, the news of this incident reached the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) so he said to me: \"O Usāmah, you killed him after he had said there is no god but Allah?\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, he only said it to protect himself.\" He repeated: \"You killed him after he had said there is no god but Allah?\" He kept repeating it until I wished I had not embraced Islam before that day.\nIn another narration: \"So the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Did he say there is no god but Allah and yet you still killed him?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, he only said it out of fear of the weapon!' He said: 'Did you split open his heart to know whether or not he meant it?'

The two sides met (in combat). There was one of the idolaters who, whenever he wanted to aim for one of the Muslims, he went straight for him and killed him. A man from the Muslims was waiting for a chance to attack him while he was unaware. We heard that it was Usāmah ibn Zayd. When he (the Muslim man) raised his sword, the idolater said \"there is no god but Allah\", but he killed him. A man came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) with news of the victory, and he asked him (about the battle) so he informed him of everything including what that man (Usāmah) had done. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) summoned him and asked him: \"Why did you kill him?\" He said: \"O Messenger of Allah, He struck many of the Muslims and killed so and so of them –and he named a group. I attacked him and when he saw the sword he said there is no god but Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah said: \"Did you kill him?\" Usasmah said: 'Yes.' The Messenger of Allah said: \"What will you do with (his statement) there is no god but Allah when it comes on the Day of Judgment?\" Usāmah said: \"O Messenger of Allah, seek forgiveness for me!\" He said: \"And what will you do with there is no god but Allah when it comes on the Day of Judgment?\" He added nothing, but kept repeating: \"What would you do with there is no god but Allah when it comes on the Day of Judgment?\"",

He said: \"It was the duty of every prophet before me to guide his people to what he knew was good for them and warn them against what he knew was bad for them. The safety of this Ummah of yours lies in its early generations, whereas its late generations will be afflicted with trials and with things that you would reject. There will be tremendous trials, one after the other, each making the previous one dwindle into significance. When they are afflicted with a trial, the believer will say: 'This is going to bring about my destruction.' When it is over, they will be afflicted with another trial and the believer will say: 'This surely is going to be my end.' Anyone wishes to be saved from the Hellfire and be admitted to Paradise should die while having belief in Allah and the Last Day, and should treat people as he wishes to be treated by them. Anyone pledges allegiance to a ruler, giving him the grasp of his hand and sincerity of his heart, he should obey him to the best of his capacity.

When you meet your enemy from among the polytheists, call them to one of three things. Whichever of them they respond to, accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. Invite them to accept Islam, and if they respond, accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. Then invite them to leave their land and move to the land of the Emigrants (Madīnah). Tell them that if they do so, they will have the same rights and duties as the Emigrants. If they refuse to move, tell them they will be like the Muslim Bedouins, subject to the rulings of Allah, and they will have no share in war booty or spoils of war, unless they fight alongside the Muslims. If they refuse to enter Islam, ask them to pay the Jjizyah (poll tax paid by non-Muslims). If they do so, accept it from them and refrain from fighting them. But if they refuse, seek the help of Allah against them and fight them. If you besiege a group and they want you to give them the covenant of Allah and His Prophet, do not give them the covenant of Allah and His Prophet, instead give them your own covenant and the covenant of your companions, for if you violate your covenant and the covenant of your companions, that is easier than violating the covenant of Allah and the covenants of His Prophet. If you besiege a group of people and they want you to apply the judgment of Allah upon them, do not offer them that, but rather offer them your own judgment, because you do not know whether you would apply correctly the judgment of Allah upon them.\"",

      "hadeeth": "Abu Sa‘īd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of Judgment?\" He said: \"Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?\" We said: 'No.' He said: \"So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing them (the sun and the moon in a clear sky).\" He then said: \"Somebody will then announce: 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship.' So the followers of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolaters will go with their idols, and the followers of every false deity will go with their deity, until those who used to worship Allah, both the pious and the sinful, and some of the People of the Book remain. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. It will be said to the Jews: 'What did you use to worship?' They will reply: 'We used to worship ‘Uzayr (Ezra), the son of Allah.' It will be said to them: 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. So what do you want?' They will reply: 'We want You to provide us with water.' It will be said to them: 'Drink, and they will fall down in Hell (instead).' Then it will be said to the Christians: 'What did you use to worship?' They will reply: 'We used to worship the Messiah, the son of Allah.' It will be said: 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. So what do you want?' They will say: 'We want You to provide us with water.' It will be said to them: 'Drink, and they will fall down in Hell (instead).' When only those who used to worship Allah, both the pious and the sinful ones, remain, it will be said to them: 'What keeps you here when all the people have gone?' They will say: 'We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today. We heard the call of one proclaiming, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship', and now we are waiting for our Lord.' Then the Almighty will come to them in a form other than the one in which they saw Him the first time, and He will say: 'I am your Lord,' and they will say: 'You are our Lord.' None will speak to Him then but the prophets, and then it will be said to them: 'Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?' They will say: 'The Shin,' and so Allah will uncover His Shin, whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him, and there those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation will remain. These people will try to prostrate, but their backs will be rigid, like a piece of wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the Sirāt will be laid across Hell.\" We, the Companions of the Prophet, said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what is the Sirāt?\" He said: \"It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and hooks like a thorny seed that is wide at one side and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa‘dān. Some of the believers will cross the Sirāt as quickly as the wink of an eye, others as quickly as lightning, as a strong wind, and as fast horses and riding camels. So some will be safe without any harm, some will become safe after having received some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell. The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge). You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming a right that has been clearly proved to be yours from me than the believers in interceding with the Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. They will say: 'O Allah, (save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us, and do good deeds with us.' Allah will say: 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of a dinar.' Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in the fire of Hell up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then return, and Allah will say (to them): 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of half a dinar.' They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say: 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom,' and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize.' If you do not believe me then read the noble verse: {Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.} [Sūrat An-Nisā: 40]\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added: \"The prophets and angels and the believers will intercede, and then the Almighty will say: 'Now remains My Intercession.' He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been charred, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise called the water of life. They will grow on its banks just as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree and how the side facing the sun is green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have seals on their necks, and then they will enter Paradise, whereupon the people of Paradise will say: 'These are the people emancipated by the Most Merciful. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).' Then it will be said to them: 'For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.'\"",

Allah will gather all mankind in one plain where an observer will be able to see (all of) them, and they will be able to hear the announcer, and the sun will come near to them. People will go through unbearable anguish and grief. They will say: 'Do you not see the (miserable) condition you are in and the state you have reached? Why do you not look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord?' Some people will say to others: 'Go to your father, Adam.'

I will raise my head and say: 'O my Lord, my Ummah, O my Lord, my Ummah, O my Lord, my Ummah.' It will be said: 'O Muhammad, admit those of your Ummah who will not go through reckoning from the right gate of Paradise, and they will also share with people other doors besides this door.' The Prophet then said: 'By Him in whose Hands my soul is, the distance between the two gateposts of the gates of Paradise is like the distance between Makkah and Hajar, or between Makkah and Busra.’\"",

O people, pray at your homes, for a person’s best prayer is the one he offers at his home except the obligatory prayer.\"",

      "hadeeth": "Suhayb ibn Sinān Ar-Rūmi (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer. When that sorcerer became old, he said to the king: 'I have become old, so send me a boy whom I will teach sorcery.' So, he sent him a boy to teach him. On his way whenever he went, there was a monk. The boy sat with him and listened to his speech and admired it. So, whenever he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat with him; and on visiting the sorcerer, the latter would beat him. The boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him: 'When you fear the sorcerer, say to him: 'My family detained me,' and when you fear your family, say to them: 'The sorcerer detained me.' The boy carried on like that (for some time). One day he saw a huge beast that prevented people from passing. The boy said: 'Today I shall know whether the sorcerer or the monk is better.' So, he took a stone and said: 'O Allah, If what the monk is upon is dearer to You than what the sorcerer is upon, then let this beast be killed so that people can pass.' Then he threw it [with the stone] and killed it and people managed to pass. The boy came to the monk and informed him about that. The monk said to him: 'O son, today you are better than me, you have come to a stage where I feel that you would soon be put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial, do not inform them about me.' The boy used to treat people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. One of the king's companions, who had become blind, heard about the boy. He brought many gifts for the boy and said: 'All these gifts are for you on condition that you cure me.' The boy said: 'I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah, the Almighty, who can cure people. If you believe in Allah, the Exalted, I will supplicate Him to cure you and He will cure you.' So, he believed in Allah, the Almighty, and Allah cured him. Later, that man came to the king and sat with him as he used to. The king said: 'Who gave you back your sight?' The man replied: 'My Lord.' The king then said: 'Do you have a Lord other than me?' The man said: 'My Lord and your Lord is Allah.' The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him: 'O son! Your magic has reached the extent that enables you to cure congenital blindness, leprosy, etc.' The boy said: 'I do not cure anyone. Only Allah, the Almighty, can cure.' So, he tortured him also until he informed him about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him: 'Abandon your religion.' The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought, and it was placed in the middle of his head and he was split until he fell in two halves. Then the king's companion was brought and it was said to him: 'Abandon your religion.' He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, split in two halves. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him: 'Abandon your religion.' He refused and so the king turned him over to a group of his people and said: 'Take him to such-and-such mountain. Ascend the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top.' They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said: 'O Allah, save me from them the way You wish.' So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said: 'What did your companions do?' The boy said: 'Allah saved me from them.' So, the king turned him over to a group of his people and said: 'Take him on a ship to the middle of the sea and ask him to renounce his religion, but if he refuses, throw him overboard.' So, they took him out to the sea and he said: 'O Allah, save me from them the way You wish.' So the ship capsized and they drowned. Then the boy came walking back to the king and the king said: 'What did your companions do?' The boy replied: 'Allah, the Almighty, saved me from them.' Then he said to the king: 'You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you.' The king asked: 'And what is that?' The boy said: 'Gather the people in one place and crucify me; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: \"In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.\" Then shoot it at me. If you do this, you will kill me.' So, the king gathered the people in one place and crucified the boy; then took an arrow from his quiver and placed the arrow in the bow, then said: \"In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy,\" then shot the arrow. It hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed: 'We believe in the Lord of the boy!' The king was approached and was told: ‘Remember what you were afraid of? By Allah, what you feared has happened; people have believed.' So he ordered that trenches should be dug at the entrances to roads, and they were dug, and fires were kindled therein. Then the king said: ‘Whoever does not renounce his religion, throw him into the fire.' They did so until a woman came with her child, and she felt hesitant about jumping into the fire, so her child said to her: 'Be patient mother, for verily, you are on the right path!’\"",

He also recited a verse at the end of Sūrat al-Hashr: (O you who believe, fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every one look what he has sent forth for the tomorrow.) Thereafter, every man gave in charity dinar, dirham, clothes, measure-fulls of wheat and measure-fulls of dates till he said: \"(Give in charity) be it half a date.\" Then a man from the Ansār came with a bag which was difficult for him to hold in his hand. Thereafter, the people came successively (with charity) till I saw two heaps of food and clothes. I noticed that the Messenger's face was glowing like that of the bright moon or glittering gold. Then he said: \"Whosoever introduces a good practice in Islam, there is for him its reward and the reward of those who act upon it after him without anything being diminished from their rewards. And whosoever introduces an evil practice in Islam will shoulder its sin and the sins of all those who will act upon it, without diminishing in any way their burden.\"",

We also used to beat off tree leaves with our sticks, then soak them in water and eat them.” He continued: “We then headed towards the sea coast, where something like a huge mound appeared to us.

Abu ‘Ubaydah took thirteen men from us and seated them in the cavity of its eye. He took one of its ribs and fixed it up, then saddled the largest camel of ours and it passed under it (the rib).

And if he appears while I am not among you, then each man will have to fend for himself. Allah will take care of every Muslim after me. He is young, with curly hair, and his eyes protruding.

He will appear from what is between the Levant and Iraq, causing devastation toward the right and toward the left. O worshipers of Allah! Hold fast!\" We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, how long will he linger on the earth?\" He said: \"Forty days, a day like a year, a day like a month, a day like a week, and the remainder of his days are like your days.\" We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, do you think that during the day that is like a year, the prayer of one day will be sufficient for us?\" He said: \"No; you will have to estimate it.\" We said: \"O Messenger of Allah, how fast will he move on the earth?\" He said: \"Like a rain storm driven by the wind. He will come upon a people and call them, and they will deny him and reject his claims. Then he will leave them, and their wealth will follow him. They will awaken in the morning with nothing left. Then he will come upon a people and call them, and they will respond to him, believing in him. So he will order the heavens to bring rain, and it will rain, and he will order the land to sprout, and it will sprout. Their cattle will return to them with their coats the longest, their udders the fullest, and their stomachs the fattest. Then he will come upon some ruins, saying to it: ‘Bring me your treasures!’ He will turn to leave it, and it will follow him like drone bees.

So while he is doing that, ‘Īsa, the son of Mariyam (peace be upon him), will descend in eastern Damascus at the white minaret, wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, drops fall of it, and when raises it, gems like pearls drop from him. His breath will not reach any disbeliever but that he will die, and his breath will reach as far as his sight. So he will pursue him (the Anti-Christ) and will catch up with him at the gate of Ludd, where he will kill him. Then people whom Allah will have protected will come to ‘Īsa, the son of Mariyam, and he will wipe their faces and inform them of their ranks in Paradise, it will be under such conditions that Allah will reveal to him: ‘I have brought forth from among My slaves such people against whom none will be able to fight; you take these people safely to At-Tūr.’ Then Allah will send Gog and Magog, and they will swarm down from every mound. The first of them will pass by the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it. And when the last of them will pass, he will say: ‘There was once water there.’ ‘Īsa and his companions will then be besieged there (and they will be so hard pressed) that the head of an ox will be dearer to one of them than one hundred dinars is to one of you today. Prophet ‘Īsa and his companions will supplicate Allah, Who will send to them insects which will attack their (Gog and Magog) necks, and in the morning they will perish like one single person. Prophet ‘Īsa and his companions will then come down to the earth (from the mountain they were on), and they will not find on the earth as much space as a single span that is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Prophet ‘Īsa and his companions will then again beseech Allah, Who will send birds whose necks will be like those of Bactrian camels, and they will carry them and throw them where Allah wills. Then Allah will send rain which no house of clay or hair will keep out, and it will wash the earth until it will appear like a mirror. Then the earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, a group of persons will be able to eat from one pomegranate and seek shelter under its skin, and a cow will give so much milk that a whole party will be able to drink it. And a camel will give so much milk that a whole tribe will be able to drink from it, and sheep will give so much milk that a whole family will be able to drink from it; and at that time, Allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothem even under their armpits, and it will take the life of every Muslim, and only the wicked people will survive, and they will commit adultery like monkeys, and those are the people to whom the Last Hour will come.\"",

So I departed with deep distress (to the point that I did not know where I was going). I did not recover until I arrived at Qarn Ath-Tha‘ālib. There, I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me. I looked and, lo and behold, I saw in it Jibrīl (peace be upon him) who called me and said: Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, heard what your people said to you and the response they gave you. He has sent to you the angel in charge of mountains to order him to do whatever you wish concerning them. Then the angel of the mountains called me, greeted me and said: O Muhammad, Allah has listened to what your people had said to you. I am the angel of  mountains, and my Lord has sent me to you so that you may give me your orders concerning them. If you wish I would bring together the Akhshabayn (two mountains that stand opposite to each other at the outskirts of Makkah) to crush them in between.\"",

A rock rolled down from the mountain and blocked the entrance to the cave. They said: 'Nothing will save you from this rock except that you supplicate Allah by virtue of your righteous deeds.' Thereupon, one of them said: 'O Allah, I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and did not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children or slaves before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet, but I waited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up until the break of dawn. When they woke up, they drank their milk. O Allah, if I did so out of seeking Your pleasure, then relieve us from the distress caused by the rock.' The rock moved slightly but they were unable to get out. The next man said: 'O Allah, I had a female cousin whom I loved more than anyone else (in another version he said: whom I loved as much as a man can ever love a woman). I tried to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would submit herself to me. She agreed and when I sat between her legs (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal except with its due right. I moved away from her despite my great passion for her, and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah, if I did that out of seeking Your pleasure, then, remove the distress we are in.' The rock moved aside but they were still unable to get out. The third man said: 'O Allah, I hired some laborers and paid them their wages except one of them who left without taking his dues. I invested his wages and it generated much money. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours including the camels, cattle, goats, and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not ridicule me. I assured him that I was not ridiculing him. So, he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah, if I did so out of seeking Your pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.'

I have wronged myself and I have admitted my sin, so forgive all my sins, for no one forgives sins but You. Guide me to the best of morals for none can guide to them but You, and deliver me from the worst of morals for none can deliver me from them but You. Here I am, in answer to Your call, happy to serve You. All good is within Your hands and evil does not stem from You. I exist by You and I turn to You. Blessed and Exalted. I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You.” When he bowed, he would say: “O Allah, it is for You that I bowed, it is in You that I believed, and it is to You that I submitted. Humbled to You are my hearing, my eyesight, my mind, my bones, and my tendons.” When he rose from bowing, he would say: “O Allah, our Lord, praise is due to You, (praise) that fills the heavens and the earth, that fills what exists between them, and that fills anything You desire afterward.” When he prostrated himself, he would say: “O Allah, it is to You that I prostrated myself, it is in You that I affirmed my faith, and it is to You that I submitted. My face has prostrated to the One who created it and shaped it and split open its faculties of hearing and seeing. Blessed is Allah, the best of Creators.” Then, one of the last things he would say between the Tashahhud and Taslīm is: “O Allah, forgive my past and future sins, my hidden and apparent sins, my transgression, and the sins that You know of more than I do. You are the One who puts forward and the One who holds back. There is no god but You.”",

Then, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) came and asked: \"Has anything been served to you or ordered for you?\" We replied: \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah,\" while we were sitting in the Prophet’s company, a shepherd suddenly drove his herd of sheep to their fold. He had with him a newly-born lamb that was crying. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked him: \"What did it bear, O so and so?\" He replied: \"An ewe.\" He said: \"Slaughter for us a sheep in place of it.\" Then, he said: \"Do not think that we are slaughtering it for you. We have one hundred sheep and we do not want their number to increase. So, whenever an ewe is born, we slaughter a sheep in its place.\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I have a wife who has something (wrong) in her tongue, i.e. she is foul-mouthed.\" He said: \"Then divorce her.\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, we have been together for long and I have children from her.\" He said: \"Then, advise her. If there is goodness in her, she will comply. And do not beat your wife as you beat your slave girl.\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, tell me something about ablution.\" He said: \"Perform ablution thoroughly, pass your fingers through each other, and snuff water well into your nostrils unless you are fasting.\"",

So Allah supported him with angels.\" Abu Zumayl reported that Ibn ‘Abbās told him: \"On that day, a Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was running in front of him, he heard the sound of a whip from above, and the voice of a rider, saying: 'Go ahead, Hayzūm.' He glanced at the polytheist, who had (then) fallen down on his back.

This was help from the third heaven.'  On that day (the day of the battle of Badr), the Muslims killed seventy disbelievers and captured seventy as captives. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them): 'What is your opinion regarding these captives?' Abu Bakr said: 'They are our kith and kin. I think you charge them a ransom (in return for releasing them), which (the ransom) will be a source of strength to us against the disbelievers. Perhaps, Allah will guide them to Islam.' Then the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'What is your opinion, O Ibn al-Khattāb?' He said: 'No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I do not agree with the opinion of Abu Bakr. I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we cut off their heads. Hand over ‘Aqīl to ‘Ali to cut off his head, and hand over such-and-such relative to me to cut off his head. These are the leaders of the disbelief and its veterans.' ‘Umar noted: 'The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) favored the opinion of Abu Bakr and did not favor what I had said. The next day, when I came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting and crying.

For I will cry, or I will at least pretend to cry in sympathy with you.’ The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: ‘I cry for what has been offered to your companions of taking the ransom (from the prisoners). I was shown the punishment to which they will be subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree.’ Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed: {It is not befitting for a Prophet that he should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed...} [Sūrat al-Anfāl: 67] {so eat of what you have gained of the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure} [Sūrat al-Anfāl: 69].

When the man moved toward the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) to greet him after the prayer, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Go back and pray again, for you have not prayed.\" The man went back and prayed as he had prayed before and he came to the Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) who said: \"Go back and pray again, for you have not prayed.\" The man said: \"O Messenger of Allah, teach me how to do it.\" He said: \"When you stand facing the Qiblah, say the Takbīr and recite the Mother of the Qur’an (Sūrat al-Fātihah), then recite whatever you like of the Qur’an. Then bow with your palms resting on your knees and your back unbent for enough time. When you rise your head, stand up straight until the bones fit well in their joints. Then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, and when you raise your head, sit on your left thigh. Then do that in every bowing and prostration.\"\nIn another narration, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: “The prayer of any one of you is not complete until he performs ablution perfectly, as Allah, the Almighty, has ordered. He should wash his face and then his hands up to the elbows, wipe his head and (wash) his feet up to the ankles. Then he should say the Takbīr and praise Allah, the Almighty. He should then recite the Qur'an as much as it is convenient for him.” He said: “He then says the Takbīr and prostrates himself, so his face or forehead is at rest on the ground and his joints return to their places and are loosened. Then he should say the Takbīr and sit to the right on his hips and keep his back erect.” He described the nature of prayer in this way by offering four Rak‘ahs until he finished it. Then he said: “The prayer of any of you is not complete unless he does this.” \nIn another version, he said: “Perform ablution as Allah, the Almighty, ordered you to, then utter the two testimonies of faith, announce the Iqāmah, and say the Takbīr.

Riders would pass by us, and we would ask them: 'What are people up to? What are people up to? Who is that man?' They would say: 'He claims that Allah has sent him and revealed to him. Or Allah has revealed such and such.'' So I used to memorize that speech, as if it was instilled in my heart. Meanwhile, the Arabs (Bedouin tribes) delayed their conversion to Islam until the Conquest. So they would say: 'Leave him and his people, for indeed if he prevails over them, he is a true Prophet.' When the incident of the people of Conquest took place, every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the rest of) my tribe. When he came back, he said: 'By Allah, I have come to you from the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) for sure! He said: 'Offer this prayer at this time and that prayer at that time. When the time for a prayer is due, let one of you call the Adhān, and let the one who knows the Qur’an most lead the prayer.'' They checked and found none with more Qur’an than me, for I used to meet the riders. Therefore, they made me to lead them, when I was only six or seven years old. I had on me a garment, which would recede when I would prostrate. A lady from the tribe thus said: 'Will you not cover the bottom of your reader from us?' So they bought (a piece of cloth) and cut me an apparel. I had never been so happy with anything as I was with that apparel.\"",

      "hadeeth": "Abu Sa‘īd al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Among those who lived before you, there was a man who had killed ninety-nine people. He asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth and was guided to a monk. When he went to him, he informed him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked if his repentance could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative, so the man killed him and made him the hundredth. After that, the man once again asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth and was guided to a scholar. He informed him of his hundred murders and asked if there was a chance for his repentance to be accepted. The scholar replied in the affirmative and said: 'Who can place a barrier between him and the repentance?' He advised him to travel to a certain land where people were worshiping Allah, the Almighty, and asked him to join them in their worship and not to return to his land, which was an evil land. The man listened to the scholar’s advice and set out from his land, when he reached the middle of the way death approached him. The angels of mercy and the angels of torment disputed over the man. The angels of mercy said: 'He came with a repenting heart to Allah, the Almighty.' The angels of torment said: 'He has never done anything good in his life.' Another angel then came in the form of a human being and they agreed to take him as an arbitrator. He said: 'Measure the distance between the man and the two lands and see to which one he is closer.' They did that and found him closer to the land he was traveling to, so the angels of mercy took his soul.” Another authentic narration reads: “He was one span closer to the land of piety, so he was considered one of its people.” The wording of another authentic narration reads: “Allah, the Almighty, ordered this land (evil place) to go far away and the other land (good place) to get closer and on measuring the distances, he was found one span closer to the village to which he intended to go and so he was forgiven.”\nAnother narration reads: “He directed his chest towards it (the village he intended to go to).”",

      "hadeeth": "‘Abdur-Rahmān ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Ka‘b ibn Mālik reported that (his father) ‘Abdullāh ibn Ka‘b ibn Mālik, who was Ka‘b's guide from among his sons when Ka‘b turned blind, said: I heard Ka‘b ibn Mālik relating a Hadīth in which he mentioned his story when he remained behind after the departure of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) for the battle of Tabūk. Ka‘b said: \"I did not miss any battle with the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) except the battle of Tabūk. In fact, I did not take part in the battle of Badr, but none who failed to take part in it was blamed, for Allah's Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had gone out to meet the caravans of the Quraysh. But Allah caused them (the Muslims) to meet their enemy unexpectedly (without prior planning). I witnessed the night of the ‘Aqabah pledge of allegiance with the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) when we jointly agreed to support Islam with all our efforts. It would not please me to have attended the battle of Badr instead of the ‘Aqabah pledge, although Badr is more notable than it among the people. As for my state at the time when I remained behind after the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had departed for the battle of Tabūk, I had never been stronger nor wealthier than I was at the time when I remained behind in that battle. By Allah, I had never been in possession of two she-camels until the time of the battle. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) used to conceal his intention to embark upon a battle by making reference to other battles, until that battle (Tabūk). The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) conducted that battle during a season of extreme heat, undertaking a lengthy journey through desert terrain. In addition, the enemy was great in number. Thus, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) clarified the matter to the Muslims, in order that they would prepare themselves properly for the battle, and he informed them of the intended destination. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was accompanied by a considerable number of Muslims, whose names could not be recorded in a register.\" Ka‘b continued: \"Any individual who wished to remain behind would assume that his absence would pass unnoticed, unless it was revealed by Allah by means of divine revelation. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) undertook that battle during a season wherein the fruit had ripened and the shade had become pleasant. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the Muslims equipped themselves with the necessary provisions. I too went out in the morning in order to prepare myself; however, I returned without accomplishing anything and said to myself I am capable of it. In this manner, I continued to postpone my preparations until the departure of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and the Muslims with him while I had not prepared what I needed to join them. I said to myself I would prepare myself a day or two after his departure then catch up with them. Again, I did not accomplish anything until they were far and the battle was over. I intended to depart and catch up with them, and I wish I did, but I was not destined for it. I would go out amongst the people after the departure of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) and it would make me sad to see no men around except one who was suspected of being a hypocrite, or a weak man whom Allah had excused from participation in battle. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) did not remember me until he reached Tabūk. He was sitting amongst his people in Tabūk and asked: 'What happened to Ka‘b ibn Mālik?' A man from the tribe of Banu Salimah responded: 'O Messenger of Allah, he was prevented by his preoccupation with his fine clothes and his self-admiration.' Mu‘ādh ibn Jabal said: 'What an evil statement you have made! By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, we do not know about him save what is good.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) remained silent.” Ka‘b ibn Mālik continued: “When I learned that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had started his journey back from Tabūk, I was consumed by distress, and thought, therefore, of inventing lies. I asked myself: With what can I avoid his anger tomorrow? I sought assistance from every individual of sound mind and judgment from my family. When it was mentioned that the arrival of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was imminent, the false excuses vanished from my mind. I knew that I could not pass safely from this situation by whatever lie I can come up with. I, therefore, resolved upon speaking the truth. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) arrived the following morning. It was his practice when he returned from a journey that he would proceed towards the mosque and perform a two-Rak‘ah prayer therein and then sit amongst the people. After those matters had taken place, those who lagged behind approached him. They started to present their excuses and take oaths to that effect. There were some and eighty men in number. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) accepted their apparent attitude and their pledge of allegiance, sought forgiveness for them, and he entrusted to Allah their secret affairs. Thereafter, I approached him, and when I greeted him, he smiled like one who is angry. Then he said: 'Come forward.' I approached him walking until I was sitting before him. Then he said: 'What prevented you from accompanying us? Had you not purchased a riding animal?' I responded: 'Yes, I did. By Allah, if I was in the presence of any other man from amongst the inhabitants of this world, I am sure that I would avoid His wrath by presenting an excuse, for I have been granted the ability to speak in an eloquently persuasive manner. However, I am aware that if I utter a lie today in order to seek your pleasure, certainly Allah will cause you to become angry with me in the future. Alternatively, if I tell you the truth, thereby causing you to become angry, I may hope for a good consequence from Allah, Exalted and Glorified. No, By Allah, I have no excuse to present. By Allah, I had never before been stronger nor wealthier than the time I failed to accompany you.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'As for this man, he has spoken the truth. So, stand up (and leave) until Allah gives a judgment concerning you.' I stood up, and a group of men from the tribe of Banu Salimah came along and followed me. They addressed me: 'By Allah! We have not known you to commit a misdeed before that. Verily you did wrong when you failed to find an excuse for yourself before the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) like the other absentees who excused themselves. It would have sufficed you against your sin that the Messenger of Allah would seek forgiveness for you.' They continued to reprimand me until I desired to return to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and speak contrary to what I had said to him before. Then I asked them: 'Is there any other individual in a similar position?' They responded: 'Yes, there are two men who uttered the same statement as you, and both received the same directive as you did. 'I asked: 'Who are these two men?' They answered: 'Murārah ibn Ar-Rabī‘ and Hilāl ibn Umayyah al-Wāqifi.' They mentioned two virtuous men who had participated in the battle of Badr and were good examples to be followed. After they had mentioned these two men, I remained steadfast upon my original statement. Thereafter, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) prohibited the Muslims from speaking to us - namely the three individuals from amongst the Muslims who failed to join him for the battle. As a consequence, the people avoided us and changed the way they treated us, until the land wherein I lived seemed strange; not one which I was familiar with. We remained in that state for the length of fifty nights. As for my two companions, they committed themselves to their houses and stayed therein, weeping. However, I was the youngest and most enduring of the three, I would therefore leave my house to perform prayer with the Muslims. I would wander around the markets, yet no one would speak to me. I would approach the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and offer the greeting of peace to him whilst he was sitting amidst his gathering after having performed the prayer. I would ask myself: Did his lips move with returning the greeting or not? Thereafter, I would perform the prayer close by him and look at him stealthily. When I was engaged with the prayer, he would turn towards me. However, when I looked in his direction, he would turn his face away from me. When this period of estrangement became too long, I set out to walk until I climbed over the wall of Abu Qatādah's garden. He was my cousin and the most beloved person to me. I offered the greeting of peace to him, and, by Allah, he did not return the greeting to me. Hence, I said: 'O Abu Qatādah, I adjure you by Allah, do you not know that I love Allah and His Messenger?' He remained silent. I appealed to him by Allah a second time, but he remained silent. Then in the third time he replied: 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' Thereupon, tears flowed from my eyes. I turned away and climbed over the wall.\" He continued: \"While I was walking in the market of Madīnah, I saw a Christian farmer from amongst the farmers of Sham (Greater Syria), who had traveled to Madīnah to sell their produce. He said: 'Who shall direct me to Ka‘b ibn Mālik?' The people pointed towards me, so he approached me and handed me a letter from the King of Ghassān. As I was a scribe, I could read the letter in which it was written: 'It has come to our knowledge that your companion has forsaken you. Verily, God has not rendered this world for you as a dwelling of disgrace and degradation, nor one of loss and destitution. So join us and we shall bestow upon you comfort and consolation.' Upon reading the letter I said to myself: This too is a trial. I went toward the oven and burnt it therein. When a period of forty out of fifty nights had passed, the messenger of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) approached me and said: 'The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commands you to stay away from your wife.' I said: 'Should I divorce her, or what should I do?' He responded: 'No, just stay away from her and do not approach her.' He issued a similar directive concerning my two companions. Hence, I said to my wife: 'Go to your parents and remain with them until Allah passes judgment on this matter.' The wife of Hilāl ibn Umayyah came to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, verily Hilāl ibn Umayyah is an old man who is incapable of taking care of himself, and he does not have a servant. Would you object if I serve him?' He replied: 'No, but he must not approach you.' She said: 'By Allah, he has no desire for any matter. By Allah, he has not ceased to weep from the day this matter started until this time now.' Some of my family members asked me: 'Why don’t you seek permission from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) concerning your wife, as he has granted permission for the wife of Hilāl ibn Umayyah to serve him?' I said: 'By Allah, I shall not seek permission from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) concerning her. I do not know what the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would say if I sought his permission in relation to her while I am still a young man.' I remained in that state for an additional ten nights, until fifty nights had passed from the time the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had prohibited the people from speaking to us. On the morning of the fiftieth night, I performed the Fajr prayer on the roof of one of our houses. While I was in the state that Allah described in His Book: feeling that my soul had become contracted, and the earth had contracted for me despite its vastness, all of a sudden, I heard a loud voice coming from the direction of Mount Sal‘. Somebody shouted at the top of his voice: 'O Ka‘b ibn Mālik, Rejoice!' I prostrated myself upon the ground, realizing that relief from this trial had finally arrived. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) told the people that Allah accepted our repentance. After the Fajr prayer, the people proceeded forth to congratulate us, and carriers of the good news rushed toward my two companions. A horseman raced towards me in order to congratulate me and a messenger from the tribe of Aslam raced towards the mountain and got over it in order to make the announcement. I heard his voice before that of the horseman. When the man whose voice I had heard approached me to convey the glad tidings, I took off my two garments and clothed him in them. By Allah, on that day I was not in possession of any other garments, so I borrowed two garments and put them on then I headed to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). People started receiving me in groups, congratulating me for the acceptance of my repentance. They said: 'We congratulate you for Allah's acceptance of your repentance.' When I entered the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was sitting surrounded by people. Talhah ibn ‘Ubaydullāh hastened towards me. He shook my hand and congratulated me. By Allah, no one from amongst the Muhājirūn stood in order to greet me save him. I never forgot that gesture from Talhah. When I greeted the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), his face was shining with happiness and he said: 'Rejoice for the best day you have witnessed since your mother gave birth to you.' I asked: 'Is this from you or from Allah?' He said: 'It is from Allah.' Whenever the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was delighted, his face became bright as if it was a piece of the moon. We recognized that as characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, part of my repentance is that I should give up my entire wealth as charity for the sake of Allah and His Messenger.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Keep a portion of your wealth, for it is better for you to do so.' I said: 'I shall keep my share in Khaybar. O Messenger of Allah, verily Allah has delivered me from this trial because I spoke the truth. My repentance therefore dictates that I shall speak only the truth as long as I live.' By Allah, I am not aware of any Muslim whom Allah has blessed for speaking the truth more than myself, from the time I mentioned those words of truth to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). By Allah, I have never intended to utter a word of falsehood from the time when I mentioned those words to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, to the present day. I hope that Allah will protect me from uttering falsehood in the remaining part of my life. Allah revealed the following verse to His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him): {Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhājirūn, and the Ansar who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a party of them had almost inclined [to doubt], and then He forgave them. Indeed, He was to them Kind and Merciful. And [He also forgave] the three who were left behind [and regretted their error] to the point that the earth closed in on them in spite of its vastness and their souls confined them and they were certain that there is no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them so they could repent. Indeed, Allah is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true} [Sūrat At-Tawbah :117-119]. By Allah, after guiding me to Islam, Allah has not bestowed upon me a favor greater in my sight than my statement of truth to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and my action of not uttering a lie to him, for I would have been ruined, as those who uttered lies were ruined. Allah ascribed to those who had uttered falsehood the most evil description he Had ever ascribed to anyone else when He revealed His statement: {They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them that you would leave them alone. So leave them alone; indeed they are evil; and their refuge is Hell as recompense for what they had been earning. They swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them. But if you should be satisfied with them - indeed, Allah is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people} [Sūrat At-Tawbah: 95-96]. Ka‘b continued: \"We, the three who lagged behind, differed from those whose excuses were accepted by the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) when they swore to him to that effect. He accepted their pledge of allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and he deferred our case until Allah passed judgment in relation to it. In reference to that, Allah Almighty said: {He also forgave the three who remained behind} [Sūrat At-Tawbah:118]. In this Verse, Allah did not refer to our remaining behind the military expedition. Rather, He refers to the deferment of passing judgment on us, in contrast to those who took an oath before the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) and excused themselves and he accepted their excuses.\"",

      "hadeeth": "Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) dispatched a secret troop of ten men under the leadership of ‘Āsim ibn Thābit al-Ansāri (may Allah be pleased with him). They proceeded until they reached Al-Had'ah, a place between ‘Usfān and Makkah, when the news reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhayl called Banu Lihyān. About one hundred of their archers hurried to track them. When ‘Āsim and his companions sensed them, they took refuge in a safe place. Their trackers circled them and said: \"Come down and surrender. We give you our pledge and covenant that we will not kill any of you.\" ‘Āsim ibn Thābit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"O people, as for me, I will not go down to be under the protection of disbelievers. O Allah, let your Prophet know what has happened to us.\" The disbelievers then shot arrows at them until they killed ‘Āsim. Three of the men went down trusting their pledge and covenant; Khubayb, Zayd ibn Ad-Dathinnah, and a third man. When the disbelievers captured them and tied them up with the strings of their bows, the third companion said: \"This is the start of a betrayal. By Allah, I will not go with you. I have a clear example in these (killed companions).\" So they dragged him and tried to force him to accompany them, but he refused, so they killed him. They took Khubayb and Zayd ibn Ad-Dathinnah with them and sold them as slaves in Makkah. This incident took place after the battle of Badr. Khubayb was bought by the children of Al-Hārith ibn ‘Āmir ibn Nawfal ibn ‘Abd Manāf. It was Khubayb who had killed Al-Hārith in the battle of Badr. Khubayb remained as their prisoner for a several days, until they decided to kill him. Khubayb borrowed a razor from one of Al-Hārith’s daughters to shave his pubic hair. Without her being aware, her little son crawled towards Khubayb. When she saw her son on Khubayb's knee and he had the razor in his hand, she was so alarmed that Khubayb noticed the agitation on her face. He said: \"Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do that.\" She later commented: \"By Allah, I never saw a prisoner better than Khubayb. By Allah, I once saw him eating a bunch of grapes from his hand while he was chained up, but there was no such fruit at that time in Makkah. It must have been a blessing that Allah had bestowed upon Khubayb.\" When they took him out of the Sacred Precincts, so they could kill him outside its boundaries, Khubayb asked them to let him pray two Rak‘ahs. They allowed him to do so, so he offered the two Rak‘ahs. Then he said: \"Had I not reckoned that you would think that I was anxious, I would have prayed more. O Allah, remove them altogether; slay them one by one and spare none of them.\" He then recited these poetic verses: \"I do not care how I will be killed as long as I will die in the cause of Allah, as a Muslim. This is for Allah's sake, and if He so wills, He may bless torn and amputated limbs.\" It was therefore Khubayb who established the Sunnah (practice) for any Muslim who is about to be killed to pray two Rak‘ahs. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) related to his Companions what had happened to the ten Companions on the day that it happened. Later, when some disbelievers from the Quraysh were informed that ‘Āsim had been killed; they sent people to fetch a recognizable part of him to confirm his death. They did so, because ‘Āsim had previously killed one of their chiefs. So Allah sent a swarm of bees, resembling a shady cloud, to hover over the body of ‘Āsim to shield him from their messengers, so they could not cut off any part of him.",

By Allah, all of them ate until they left the food and went off while our cooking pot was still full with meat as before and the dough continued to be baked as before.\"",

      "hadeeth": "Abu Khubayb ‘Abdullāh ibn Az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Az-Zubayr got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me: \"O my son, today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think that anything will be left of our property after the debts are settled?\" Then he said: \"O my son, sell our property and pay my debts.\" He then willed (bequeathed) one-third of his property and willed one-third of that portion to ‘Abdullāh's sons. He said: \"One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the settlement of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.\" (Hisham, a sub-narrator, said: \"Some of the sons of ‘Abdullāh were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubayr, like Khubayb and ‘Abbād. ‘Abdullāh had nine sons and nine daughters at that time.\") ‘Abdullāh added: \"He (Az-Zubayr) went on advising me regarding his debts, saying: 'If you should fail to settle part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you.' By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I asked, 'O father, who is your Master?' He replied: 'Allah (is my Master).' By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say: 'O Master of Az-Zubayr, settle his debts on his behalf,' and Allah would (help me to) settle it. Az-Zubayr was martyred leaving no dinar or dirham except for land and property, including a land which was (called) Al-Ghāba, and eleven houses in Madīnah, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. The source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him, Az-Zubayr would say: 'No, (I won't keep it as a trust) but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.' Az-Zubayr was never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and ‘Uthmān (may Allah be pleased with them). When I counted his debt, it turned out to be two million and two hundred thousand.\" (The sub-narrator added:) Hakīm ibn Hizam met ‘Abdullāh ibn Az-Zubayr and asked him: \"O my nephew, how much is the debt of my brother?\" ‘Abdullāh did not reveal the exact amount and said: \"One hundred thousand.\" Hakīm said: \"By Allah! I don't think your property will cover it.\" Upon that, ‘Abdullāh said to him: \"What if I told you that it is two million and two hundred thousand?\" Hakīm said: \"I don't think you can repay it; so if you are unable to repay all of it, I will help you.\" Az-Zubayr had bought Al-Ghāba for one hundred and seventy thousand. ‘Abdullāh sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he called out to the people saying: \"Any person who has any money claim on Az-Zubayr should come to us in Al-Ghāba.\" There came to him ‘Abdullāh ibn Ja‘far whom Az-Zubayr owed four hundred thousand. He said to ‘Abdullāh, \"If you wish I will forgo the debt.\" ‘Abdullāh said: 'No.' Then Ibn Ja‘far said: \"If you wish you can defer repayment if you are going to defer the repayment of any debt.\" ‘Abdullāh said: 'No.' Ibn Ja‘far said: \"Then give me a piece of the land.\" ‘Abdullāh said (to him): \"Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.\" So, ‘Abdullāh sold most of the land and settled the debt perfectly, with four and a half shares remaining unsold from the land of Al-Ghāba. He then went to Mu‘āwiyah while ‘Amr ibn ‘Uthmān, Al-Mundhir ibn Az-Zubayr and Ibn Zam‘ah were sitting with him. Mu‘āwiyah asked: \"At what price have you appraised Al-Ghāba?\" He said: \"One hundred thousand for each share.\" Mu‘āwiyah asked: \"How many shares are left?\" ‘Abdullāh replied: \"Four and a half shares.\" Al-Mundhir ibn Az-Zubayr said: \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" ‘Amr ibn ‘Uthmān said: \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Ibn Zam‘ah said: \"I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.\" Mu‘āwiyah said: \"How much is left now?\" ‘Abdullāh replied: \"One share and a half.\" Mu‘āwiyah said: \"I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand.\" ‘Abdullāh ibn Ja‘far then sold his share to Mu‘āwiyah for six hundred thousand. When ‘Abdullāh ibn Az-Zubayr had paid all the debts, Az-Zubayr's other sons said to him, \"Distribute our inheritance among us.\" He said: \"No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons: 'Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubayr come so that we may repay them.\" So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the heirs. Az-Zubayr had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand.",

He said: 'A good color, fine skin, and to get rid of what makes me disgusting in the eyes of people.' He wiped over his body, so his illness went away and he was given a good color and fine skin. He (the angel) said: 'Which wealth do you like most?' He said: 'Camels, or cows (the sub-narrator Is'hāq was in doubt).' So he was given a she-camel in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and he (the angel) said: 'May Allah bless it for you.' Then he went to the bald-headed man and said: 'Which thing do you like most?' He said: 'Good hair, and to get rid of what makes me disgusting in the eyes of people.' He wiped over his head, so his condition went away and he was given good hair. Then the angel said: 'Which wealth do you like most?' He said: 'Cows or camels.' So, he was given a pregnant cow and the angel said: 'May Allah bless it for you.' Then he went to the blind man and said: 'Which thing do you like most?' He said: 'That Allah restores to me my eyesight so that I can see people.' He wiped over his eyes, so Allah restored to him his eyesight. Then the angel said: 'Which wealth do you like most?' He said: 'Sheep.' So he was given a pregnant ewe. The three then had offspring from the ones given to them: one had a valley of camels, the second a valley of cows, and the third a valley of sheep. Later, the angel went to the leper in his (past) appearance and said: 'I am a poor person, and I am running out of provision in my journey, so I cannot reach my destination except with the help of Allah and then your favor. I ask you by the One Who gave you good color, fine skin and wealth to give me one camel to carry me in my journey.' He said: 'I have many rights to fulfill.' Thereupon, he (the angel) said: 'It seems to me that I know you. Were you not a leper whom people found disgusting, and a poor man then Allah gave you wealth?' He said: 'I have inherited this wealth from my forefathers.' Thereupon, the angel said: 'If you are lying, may Allah change you to your past condition.' He then went in his (past) appearance to the bald-headed man and said to him the same as what he had said to the leper, and he replied to him in the same way the leper did. So, the angel said: 'If you are lying, may Allah change you to your past condition.' Then he went in his (past) appearance to the blind man and said: 'I am a poor man and a wayfarer. My provisions have run short in my journey, and today there is no way to reach my destination except with the help of Allah and then with your help. So, I ask you by the One Who restored to you your eyesight to give me one sheep by which I should be able to make provisions for the journey.' The man said: 'I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight. You may take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah, I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of Allah.' Thereupon, the angel said: 'Keep your property. The fact is that the three of you were put to test.

      "hadeeth": "Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) often used to ask his Companions: \"Did anyone of you have a dream?\" So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah willed to relate. One day he said: \"Last night, I had a vision in which two men (angels) came to me, woke me up and said to me: 'Let’s go!' So I set out with them. We came across a man lying down and another man was standing over his head holding a big rock. He was throwing the rock at the man's head, smashing it. When it struck him, the stone rolled away and he (the thrower) followed it and picked it up. No sooner had he returned to the (first) man than his head was restored to its former state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions: 'Glory be to Allah! Who are they?' They said: 'Let’s go, let’s go!' So we proceeded on and came to a man lying flat on his back with another man standing over his head with an iron hook. He would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eyes from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he has done with the first side. He had hardly completed that side, when the first returned to its normal state. I said to my two companions: 'Glory be to Allah! Who are these?' They said: 'Let’s go, Let’s go!' So we proceeded on and came across something like a Tannūr (a pit, usually clay-lined, for baking bread).\" I (the narrator) think the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"There was a lot of noise and voices in that oven.\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added: ‘We looked into it and saw naked men and women, and a flame was reaching up to them from underneath, and when it reached them they cried out loudly. I asked: 'Who are these?' They said to me: 'Let’s go, Let’s go!' So we proceeded on and came across a river.’\" I (the narrator) think he said: “…red, like blood.” The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added: \"...and in the river, there was a man swimming, and on the bank, there was a man who had collected many stones. While the other man was swimming, the first man went up to him. The former (who was swimming) opened his mouth and the latter on the bank threw a stone into his mouth, he then went on swimming again. Then again, he (the former) returned to him (the latter), and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth and the latter threw a stone into his mouth; the process was repeated. I asked my two companions: “Who are these?” They replied: 'Let’s go, Let’s go!' We proceeded on until we came to a man with a repulsive appearance; the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my two companions: 'Who is this (man).' They said to me: 'Let’s go, let’s go!' So we proceeded on until we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation with all sorts of spring flowers. In the middle of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head due to his towering height. Around him there were children in such an enormous number as I have never seen. I said to my two companions: 'Who is this?' They replied: 'Let’s go, let’s go!' So we proceeded on until we came to a majestic, huge garden, greater and better than any garden I have ever seen. My two companions said to me: 'Go up!' So I went up.\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added. \"So we ascended until we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks, and went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened. We entered the city and found there men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions told those men to throw themselves into the river. There was a river flowing across (the city) and its water was milky white. The men went and threw themselves in it and returned to us after their ugliness had disappeared, and they came in the best of shapes.’ The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) further added: ‘My two companions said to me: 'This place is Paradise of Eden, and that is your palace.' I raised up my sight and there I saw a palace, like a white cloud. My two companions said to me: 'That palace is your residence.' I said to them: 'May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied: 'You will not enter it  now, but you shall enter it (one day).' I said to them: 'I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that I have seen mean?' They replied: 'We will tell you: As for the first man you came upon, whose head was being smashed with the rock, he was a man who learns the Qur'an and discards it, and who sleeps neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon, whose was having the sides of mouth, nostrils, and eyes torn off from front to back, he was a man who leaves his house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world. Those naked men and women you saw in the oven-like construction, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses. The man who was given a stone to swallow was the eater of usury and the repulsive-looking man you saw near the fire, kindling it, and going around it, was Mālik, the gatekeeper of Hell. The tall man you saw in the garden was Prophet Ibrahīm (peace be upon him) and the children around him are those who died upon the Fitrah.'\"\nAccording to Al-Barqāni's narration: “…were those who were born upon the Fitrah” The narrator added: “Some Muslims asked the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) ‘O Messenger of Allah, what about the children of the polytheists?’ The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) replied: ‘And also the children of the polytheists.’ The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added: ‘My two companions added: 'The men you saw who were half handsome and half ugly were these people who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'\" According to another narration: The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"One night two men came to me and took me to a sacred land.” The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) told of the same incident as above and said: \"After walking for a while, we came upon a pit, like an oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom with a fire raging in it. When the flames rose up (the people in it) also rose up until they were about to come out of it, and when the fire subsided they too would go down with it. In it were naked men and women.” In this narration, we also find: \"We came upon a river of blood,” and the narrator was not doubtful: “...a man was in it, and another man was standing on its bank with stones in front of him facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone into his mouth which made him retreat to his original position. So, whenever he wanted to come out, the other would throw a stone into his mouth and he would retreat to his original position.” In this narration, we also find: \"They made me climb the tree and they made me enter an abode so beautiful, the like of which I have never seen before...There (I saw) old men and youths.” In this narration, we also find: “As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority until they spread all over the world. So he will be punished like that until the Day of Resurrection...The one whose head you saw being crushed is a man whom Allah had given knowledge of Qur'an, but he used to sleep at night (meaning: he did not recite it then) and he did not act upon it (meaning: act upon its orders, etc.) by day. So this punishment will go on until the Day of Resurrection. The first house you entered was the abode of the believers in general and the other house was the abode of the martyrs. I am Jibrīl, and this is Mikā'īl. Raise your head.” I looked up and saw something like clouds. They said to me: “That is your abode.” I said: “Let me enter it.” They said: “You have not completed your life term yet. When you do, you will certainly enter it.\"",

      "hadeeth": "‘Amr ibn ‘Abasah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 'In the pre-Islamic time of ignorance, I used to think that people were misguided. They were not on a right path, as they worshipped idols. Then I heard of a man in Makkah who was telling news. So I mounted my camel and went to him. It was the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He was hiding, since his own people were aggressive toward him. So I acted gently until I entered upon him. I said to him, \"Who are you?\" He said: \"I am a Prophet.\" I said: \"What is a Prophet?\" He said: \"Allah has sent me.'' I said: \"With what has He sent you?\" He said: \"He sent me with [a message] of maintaining kinship ties, breaking the idols, and upholding the oneness of Allah without associating anything with him.\" I said: \"Who is with you on that?\" He said: \"A free man and a slave man.'' (At that time only Abu Bakr and Bilāl (may Allah be pleased with both of them) were with him. I said: \"I shall follow you.'' He said: \"You cannot do that today. Do you not see my situation and that of the people? However, go back to your people, and when you hear that I have succeeded in my mission, come to me.'' So I went to my people. Later, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went to Madīnah. It was until some of my people went to Madīnah., that I said: \"What happened to this man who came to Madīnah?\" They said: \"People are hastening to him. His own people wanted to kill him, but they could not.\" So I went to Madīnah and entered upon him and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?\" He said: \"Yes, you are the one who met me in Makkah.\" I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, tell me about what Allah has taught you, which I am unaware of. Tell me about prayer.\" He said: \"Perform the morning prayer. Then do not pray until the sun has risen up to the height of a lance, for when it rises, it rises between two horns of a devil. It is when the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it. Then pray, for prayer is witnessed and attended, until the shadow of the lance shrinks. Then do not pray, for at that time Hell is fired up. Then pray when the shadow becomes longer, for the prayer is witnessed and attended, until you perform ‘Asr. Then do not pray until the sun sets, for it sets between two horns of a devil. It is when the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it.\" I further said: ''O Prophet, tell me about ablution.'' He said: \"When anyone of you approaches his ablution water, and rinses his mouth and nose, the sins of his face fall with water from the edges of his beard. Then when he washes his hands up to elbows, the sins of his hands fall with water from his fingertips. Then when he wipes over his head, the sins of his head fall with water from the ends of his hair. Then when he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall with water from his toes. Then, when he stands up for prayer, praises Allah, the Almighty,, extols Him, glorifies Him as He deserves, and empties his heart for Allah, the Almighty, he becomes free from his sins as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him.'' ‘Amr ibn ‘Abasah narrated this Hadīth to Abu Umāmah, a companion of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Abu Umāmah, therefore, said to him: \"O ‘Amr ibn ‘Abasah, think about what you are saying. Will a man be getting all of this on one occasion?\" ‘Amr said: \"O Abu Umāmah, I am old in age, weak in bones, and close to death. I do not need to tell lies about Allah and His Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). Had I not heard this from the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) only once, twice, thrice (he counted up to seven times), I would have not reported it. However, I heard it more than that.''",

      "hadeeth": "Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: One of the sons of Abu Talha was ailing. Abu Talha went out and the boy died in his absence. When he came back, he inquired: \"How is the boy?\" Umm Sulaym, the boy’s mother, replied: \"He could not be more tranquil than he is now.\" She served him supper, and he ate it and then they had sexual intercourse. Afterwards, she said to him: \"Arrange for the burial of the boy.\" In the morning, Abu Talha went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and informed him of what had happened. He asked: \"Did you sleep together last night?\" Abu Talha said: ‘Yes.’ So the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) supplicated: \"O Allah, bless them.\" Later, she gave birth to a baby boy. Abu Talha said to me: \"Pick up the boy and take him to the Prophet.\" He sent some dates with him. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) asked: \"Is there anything with him?\" He said: \"Yes, some dates.\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) took a date, chewed it, and put it in the mouth of the baby, rubbing the chewed date around the baby's gum. He named him ‘Abdullāh.\nIn another version: Ibn ‘Uyaynah reported: “A man from the Ansār said: ‘I saw nine sons (of this boy), all of whom were reciters of the Qur’an.’”\nAnother version reads: “Abu Talha’s son from Umm Sulaym died. She asked family members not to tell Abu Talha about his son, as she would inform him herself. Abu Talha came home and she gave him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself in the best way she had ever done, and he slept with her. Noticing that he was gratified, she said: ‘O Abu Talha. If some people borrow something from another family and then the lenders ask for their item, would they refuse to give it back to them?’ He said: ‘No.’ She said: ‘Then, seek divine reward for the loss of your son.’ Abu Talha got angry and said: ‘You did not tell me this until I stained myself (with sexual intercourse), and now you tell me about my son!’ He went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and told him about the matter, and he said: ‘May Allah bless the night you spent together!’ And she conceived a child. One day the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was on a journey and she was with him. Whenever he came back from a journey to Madīnah, he would not enter it at night. As they approached Madīnah, she felt labor pains. Abu Talha remained with her and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) carried on. Abu Talha said: ‘O Lord, You know that I love to go out with the Messenger of Allah when he goes out and enter with him when he enters, and I have been detained as You see.’ Umm Sulaym said: ‘O Abu Talha, I do not feel as much pain as I was feeling earlier, so we had better move on.’ We carried on and she felt the birth pangs as they reached Madīnah and gave birth to a baby boy. My mother said to me: ‘O Anas, no one should suckle him until you take him to the Messenger of Allah in the early morning. Next morning, I carried the baby to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him… and he narrated the rest of the story.",

Jurayj was a worshiper. He had a hermitage and while he was there, his mother came in and called him while he was praying. He asked: ‘My Lord, my mother or my prayer?’ And he continued his prayer, so she left. The next day she came again and called him while he was in prayer. He asked: ‘My Lord, my mother or my prayer?’  and he continued his prayer. The following day she came again and called him while he was in prayer. He asked: ‘My Lord, my mother or my prayer?’ and he continued his prayer. She said: ‘O Allah, do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes.’ The Children of Israel talked about Jurayj and his worship. There was a prostitute who they took to be an icon of beauty.  She offered to seduce him. She tried to do so, but he did not pay her any attention. So she approached a herdsman who used to take refuge in Jurayj’s hermitage. She offered herself to him and he had sexual intercourse with her. She became pregnant, and when she gave birth she claimed that it was Jurayj’s son. The people went to him, invoked curses upon him, destroyed his hermitage, and attacked him. He said: ‘Why are you doing this?’ They replied: ‘You fornicated with this woman and she bore you a child.’ He asked: ‘Where is the child?’ So, they brought the child to him. He said: ‘Leave me until I pray.’ When he had finished praying he came to the boy and poked him in the stomach, and said: ‘O boy, who is your father?’ The boy responded: ‘So-and-so, the herdsman.’ So the people turned to Jurayj, kissing him and touching him, seeking his blessing. They offered to rebuild his hermitage with gold, but he refused and asked them to rebuild it with mud, just as it had been before, and so they did. There was also a baby, who was suckling from his mother when a rider dressed in fine garments passed by on an agile animal. His mother said: ‘O Allah, make my child like this one.’ The baby stopped suckling and looked at the man, and said: ‘O Allah, do not make me like him.’ He then continued suckling.”\nAbu Hurayrah said: “It is as if I can see the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) right now demonstrating the baby suckling with his forefinger in his mouth.”\nHe (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) continued: “And some people passed by holding a slave girl, who they were beating and accusing of fornication and theft. She was saying: ‘Sufficient is Allah for me, and the best of Guardians is He.’ The mother said: ‘O Allah, do not make my child like her.’ Again the baby stopped suckling, looked at her and said: ‘O Allah, make me like her.’ At this point they spoke to each other. The mother said: ‘A good looking man passed by and I asked Allah to make my son like him, and you asked Allah not to make you like him. Then, the people passed by with this slave girl who was being beaten and accused of fornication and theft, and I asked Allah not to make my son like her and you asked Allah to make you like her!’ The child said: ‘The man was a tyrant, so I asked Allah not to make me like him.

Ubay ibn Ka‘b reported: The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Mūsa stood to deliver a speech before the Children of Israel and the people asked him: ‘Who is the most learned person among the people?’ Mūsa replied: ‘I am.’ Allah rebuked him because he did not attribute the knowledge to Him. So Allah revealed to him: ‘At the junction of the two seas, there is a servant of Ours who is more learned than you.’ Mūsa asked: ‘O my Lord, how can I meet him?’ Allah said: ‘Take a fish and put it in a basket and then set out, and where you lose the fish, you will find him.’ So he set out along with his boy-servant Yūsha‘ ibn Nūn, and they carried a fish inside a large basket until they reached a rock (on which) they both laid their heads down and slept. The fish snuck out of the basket and slipped off through the sea. Mūsa and his boy-servant were astonished. They continued on through the rest of the night and day, and the next morning Mūsa said to his boy-servant: ‘Bring us our meal; truly, we have suffered much fatigue on this journey.’ Mūsa did not feel tired until he had passed the place that Allah had told him to look for. His boy-servant then said to him: ‘Do you remember when we rested on the rock? Well, I forgot all about the fish; and it was none other than the devil who made me forget.’ Mūsa said: ‘That was what we have been looking for,’ so they returned, retracing their footsteps. When they reached the rock, they found a man shrouded with a robe. Mūsa greeted him with the greeting of peace. Al-Khidr said: ‘Is there (such a greeting of) peace in your land?’ Mūsa said: ‘I am Mūsa.’ He said: ‘Are you the Mūsa of the Children of Israel?’ Mūsa said: ‘Yes,’ and added: ‘May I follow you so you can teach me something of the guidance that you have been taught?’ Al-Khidr said: ‘You will not be able to have patience with me. O Mūsa. I have some of Allah's knowledge, which He has bestowed upon me that you do not know, and you too, have some of Allah's knowledge, which He has bestowed upon you that I do not know.’ Mūsa said: ‘If Allah wills, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you.’ So they set out walking along the shore, until a boat passed by and they asked the crew to let them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khidr and allowed them on board free of charge. A bird came and perched on the edge of the boat and pecked in the sea once or twice. Al-Khidr said: ‘My knowledge and your knowledge compared to Allah's knowledge are like the pecking of that bird in the sea.’ Al-Khidr then broke one of the boat's panels and pulled it out. Mūsa said to him: ‘These people gave us a free ride, yet you have broken their boat so its people will drown!’ Al-Khidr said: ‘Did I not say that you would not be able to have patience with me?’ Mūsa said: ‘Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me in my affairs.’ So Mūsa’s first questioning was due to forgetfulness. They both continued on and came upon a boy playing with some other boys. Al-Khidr took hold of the boy's head and pulled it right off with his hands, killing him. Mūsa said to him: ‘Have you killed an innocent soul without a right?’ He said: ‘Did I not say to you that you would not be able to have patience with me?’ Ibn ‘Uyaynah said: ‘And this was more assertive.’ They continued on until they came to a town and they asked the people for some food, but they refused to entertain them. They found a wall in the town that was on the point of falling down. Al-Khidr set it straight with his own hands. Mūsa said: ‘If you had wished, surely, you could have asked for wages for that!’ He said: \"This is the parting between you and me.’\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"May Allah have mercy on Mūsa! If only he had had more patience so Allah could have told us more about them both!\"",

The former replied: \"Allah is sufficient as witness.\" The second said: \"Bring me a surety.\" The former replied: \"Allah is sufficient as surety.\" The man said: \"You are right,\" and lent him the money for a certain period. The first man went across the sea. When he finished his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach the other in time for the repayment of the debt, but he could not find any. So he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it, inserted one thousand dinars and a letter to the lender in it, and then firmly closed (i.e. sealed) the hole. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said: \"O Allah, You know well that I took a loan of one thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me, but I told him that Allah's guarantee was sufficient, and he accepted Your guarantee. He then asked for a witness, and I told him that Allah was sufficient as witness, and he accepted You as Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so that I could give him his money, but I could not find any, so I hand over this money to You.\" Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile, he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the creditor's country. One day, the lender came out to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, when all of a sudden, he saw the piece of wood in which his money had been deposited. He took it home to use it for fire. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came, bringing one thousand dinars to him, and he said: \"By Allah, I had been trying hard to find a boat so that I could send you your money, but I failed to find one before the one I have come by.\" The lender asked: \"Have you sent something to me?\" The debtor replied: \"I told you I could not find a boat other than the one I have come by.\" The lender said: \"Allah has delivered the money which you sent in the piece of wood on your behalf.

      "hadeeth": "Ibn ‘Abbās (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: “While the mother of Isma‘īl was breastfeeding her son Isma‘īl, Ibrahīm (peace be upon him) brought them to a place near the House (the Ka‘bah); under a tree on the spot of Zamzam and the highest place in the Mosque. During those days there was nobody in Makkah nor was there any water. He settled them there and placed a leather bag containing some dates and a small waterskin containing some water near them, and then set off homeward. Isma‘īl's mother followed him saying: ‘O Ibrahīm, where are you going and leaving us in this valley where there is no one whose company we may enjoy nor is there anything here?’ She repeated it many times, but he did not look back at her. So she asked him: ‘Has Allah ordered you to do this?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ’Then He will not neglect us.’ She returned and Ibrahīm proceeded onwards, and, on reaching the Thaniyyah where they could not see him, he faced the Ka‘bah and raising both hands, invoked Allah with the following supplications: {Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful} [Sūrat Ibrahīm: 37]. Isma‘īl's mother continued breastfeeding him (Isma‘īl) and drinking the water (she had). When the water in the waterskin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him tossing in agony. She left him, because she could not endure looking at him, and found that Mount Safa was the nearest mountain to her in that area. She stood on it and started looking down the valley keenly to see if she could see anybody, but she could not. She descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she lifted up her robe and ran along the valley like a person in distress, until she had crossed the valley and reached Mount Marwah, on which she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she did not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwah) seven times. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: ‘This is the source of the tradition of walking between them (Safa and Marwah).’ When she reached Marwah (for the last time) she heard a voice and she told herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said: 'O (whoever you may be), you have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?’ And behold, she saw an angel in the Zamzam area, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing) until water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started using her hands to fill her waterskin with water. The water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) commented: ‘May Allah bestow Mercy on Isma‘īl's mother! Had she let Zamzam (to flow without trying to control it or had she not scooped that water to fill her waterskin), Zamzam would just have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.’ The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) further added: ‘Then she drank and breastfed her child.’ The angel said to her: 'Do not be afraid of being neglected; this is the House of Allah, which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people.' The House (the Ka‘bah) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents (of rain) came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived that way until some people from the tribe of Jurhum - or a family from Jurhum - passed by her and her child, as they (the Jurhum) were coming through the Way of Kadā'. They settled in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird hovering. They said: 'This bird must be flying around water; although we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent out one or two messengers, who discovered the source of water and returned to inform them of it. So, they all came (towards the water). They arrived while Isma‘īl's mother was sitting near the water and asked her: 'Would you allow us to stay with you?' She replied: 'Yes, but you will have no right over the water.' They agreed to that. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) further said: ’Isma‘īl's mother was pleased with the whole situation, as she loved having the company of people.’ So, they settled there and later they sent for their families, who came and settled with them, so some of the families became permanent residents there. The child (Isma‘īl) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up. When he reached the age of puberty, they made him marry a woman from among them. After Isma‘īl's mother had died and after Isma‘īl's marriage, Ibrahīm arrived to see the family that he had left there previously, but he did not find Isma‘īl there. When he asked Isma‘īl's wife about him, she replied: 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied: 'We are living in misery, we are living in hardship and destitution,' complaining to him. He said: 'When your husband returns, convey my greetings to him and tell him to change the threshold of the door (of his house).' When Isma‘īl came back, he felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, 'Has anyone visited you?' She replied, 'Yes, an old man of such-and-such description came and asked me about you, and I told him (how you were). He also asked how we were living, and I told him that we were living in hardship and poverty.' So Isma‘īl asked: 'Did he advise you of anything?' She replied: 'Yes, he told me to convey his greetings to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your door.' Isma‘īl said: 'That was my father and he has told me to divorce you. Go back to your family.' So Isma‘īl divorced her and married another woman from among them (the Jurhum). Ibrahīm stayed away from them for a period that lasted as long as Allah wished and then called on them again, but again did not find Isma‘īl. So he went to Isma‘īl's wife and asked her about him. She said: 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Ibrahīm asked her: 'How are you getting on?' asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied: 'We are prosperous and well-off (we have everything in abundance).' Then she thanked Allah. Ibrahīm asked: 'What kind of food do you eat?' She said: 'Meat.' He asked: 'What do you drink?' She said: 'Water.’ He supplicated, ‘O Allah, bless their meat and water.’ The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added: ‘At that time they did not have grain, and if they had had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.’ The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added: ‘If somebody has only these two things for sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Makkah.’ In another narration: [Ibrahīm] came and asked: ’Where is Isma‘īl?’ His wife said: ’'He went to hunt.’ His wife said: ’Will you not come in to eat and drink?’ He said: ‘What is your food and drink?’ She said: ‘Our food is meat and our drink is water.’ He said: ‘O Allah, Bless their food and drink.’ The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: ‘Such is the blessing of the prayer of Ibrahīm.’ Then Ibrahīm said to Isma‘īl's wife: ‘When your husband comes back, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep the threshold of his door firm.' When Isma‘īl came back, he asked his wife: 'Did anyone call on you?' She replied: 'Yes, a good-looking old man came to see me,' and she praised him and added: 'He asked about you, and I told him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we are in a good condition.' Isma‘īl asked her: 'Did he give you any advice?' She said: 'Yes, he told me to convey his regards to you and said that you should keep firm the threshold of your door.' On that Isma‘īl said: 'That was my father, and you are the threshold (of the door). He has told me to keep you with me.' Then Ibrahīm stayed away from them for a period that lasted for as long as Allah wished and called on them after that. He saw Isma‘īl under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibrahīm, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does to his son or a son does to his father). Ibrahīm said: 'O Isma‘īl, Allah has given me an order.' Ishmael said: 'Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.' Ibrahīm asked: 'Will you help me?' Isma‘īl said: 'I will help you.' Ibrahīm said: ‘Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) added: ‘They then raised the foundations of the House. Isma‘īl was bringing the stones and Ibrahīm was building them, and when the walls were high, Isma‘īl brought this stone and placed it for Ibrahīm who stood over it and carried on building. While Isma‘īl was handing him the stones, both of them were saying: {O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.} In another narration: ''Ibrahīm took Isma‘īl and the mother of Isma‘īl and went away. They had a waterskin with them containing some water. Isma‘īl's mother would drink water from the water-skin, so her milk would flow for her child. When Ibrahīm reached Makkah, he told her to stay under a tree and afterwards returned home. Isma‘īl's mother followed him, and when they reached Kadā', she called to him from behind: 'O Ibrahīm, to whom are you leaving us?' He replied: 'To Allah.' She said: 'I am pleased to be with Allah.' She returned to her place and started drinking water from the waterskin, and her milk flowed for her child. When the water had all been used up, she said to herself: 'I should go and look to see if I can see somebody.' She ascended Mount Safa and looked in vain, hoping to see somebody. When she came down to the valley, she ran until she reached Mount Marwah. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) many times. Then she said to herself: 'I should go and see how the child is,' she went and found him in a state; on the point of dying. She could not endure to watch him dying and said (to herself): 'If I go and look, I might find somebody.' She ascended Mount Safa and looked for a long while, but could not see anybody. In this way, she completed seven rounds (running) between Safa and Marwah. Again she said (to herself): 'I should go back and see how the child is.' Suddenly she heard a voice and she said to that strange voice: 'Help us if you can offer any help.' Lo and behold, it was Jibrīl (whose voice she had heard). Jibrīl hit the earth with his heel like this, and water gushed out. Isma‘īl's mother was astonished and started scooping...\"",

So when ‘Umar woke up and saw what happened to the people, and being a strict man, he said: \"Allah Akbar\" raising his voice with Takbīr. He kept on making Takbīr raising his voice with it until the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) woke up by his voice. When he got up, people complained to him about what had happened to them. He said: \"There is no harm (or it does not matter). Depart!\" So he departed. He walked not too long, and then dismounted and asked for water and made ablution. The call for the prayer was made, and he led people in prayer. After finishing the prayer, he saw a man in isolation. He did not pray with the people. So [the Prophet] asked, \"O so and so! What  prevented you from praying with the people?\" He replied, \"I have had a ritual impurity and there is no water.\" So he said: \"Use earth; it is sufficient for you.\" Then the Prophet proceeded on and people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon, he dismounted and called a person and 'Ali. He said to them: “Go and find water.” So they departed and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked: \"Where is water?\" She said: \"I was at water this hour yesterday, and our men are absent.\" They said to her, “Then go.” She asked: \"Where?\" They said: \"To the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him).\" She said: \"The one who is called Sābi' (apostate/who renounce his forefathers' religion)?\" They said: \"He is the one whom you mean. So come along.\" They brought her to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and told him the story. He said: \"Help her to dismount her camel.\" The Prophet asked for a pot and poured in it water from the mouths of the two bags. Then he tied their mouths and released their bottoms. People were called upon to drink and water their animals. So whoever wanted to drink did so, and whoever wanted to water their animals did so. Last of all, the Prophet gave a pot of water to the person who had a ritual impurity and said: “Go and pour it on you.” The woman was there looking at what was being done with her water. By Allah, when it was done with [her bags], they looked to us as if they were fuller than it was when they started taking [water] from the bags. Then the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Collect something for her.” So they collected for her some ‘Ajwa (dates of Madīnah), flour and some dough, until some food was gathered for her, which they put in a piece of cloth. They helped her mount her camel and put that cloth in front of her. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to her: \"You know, we have not taken any of your water; it was Allah who has given us water.\" She went to her people, when she was delayed from her people. So they said: \"O so and so what has delayed you?\" She said: \"A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called Sābi' who did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers toward the sky and earth) or he is really the Messenger of Allah.\" Afterward, Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched the area to which it belonged. One day she said to her people, \"I do not think that these people leave you on purpose. So have you got any inclination to Islam?\" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.",

      "hadeeth": "‘Awf ibn Mālik – or ibn al-Hārith – ibn at-Tufayl reported: ‘Ā’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was told that ‘Abdullāh ibn Az-Zubayr, upon hearing that she was selling or giving something as a gift, said: \"By Allah, if ‘Ā’ishah does not give this up, I will declare her incompetent to dispose of her wealth.\" She asked: \"Did he say so?\" They replied: ‘Yes.’ So she said: \"I vow to Allah that I will never speak to Ibn Az-Zubayr.\" When this separation had lasted for a long time, Ibn Az-Zubayr sought to intercede with her, but she said: \"By Allah, I will not accept the intercession of anyone for him and will not commit a sin by breaking my vow.\" As this state of affairs continued for long, Ibn Az-Zubayr was concerned and he approached Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah and ‘Abdur-Rahmān ibn al-Aswad ibn ‘Abd Yaghūth and said to them: \"I beseech you by Allah to help me to visit ‘Ā’ishah; it is unlawful for her to vow to sever ties with me.\" Al-Miswar and ‘Abdur-Rahmān took him to ‘Ā’ishah and asked for permission to enter her house, saying: \"Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you! May we come in?\" She said: \"Come in.\" They said: \"All of us?\" She said: \"Yes, come in all of you,\" unaware that Ibn Az-Zubayr was with them. As they came in, Ibn Az-Zubayr entered the screened place and took hold of ‘Ā’ishah and was weeping and imploring her to forgive him. Al-Miswar and ‘Abdur-Rahmān also were begging her to speak to him and accept his apology. They said: \"As you know, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) forbade a Muslim from forsaking his fellow Muslim, and it is unlawful for a Muslim to do so for more than three days.\" As they continued to remind and press her, she began to weep and say: \"I made a vow, and a vow is something grave.\" They persisted in their appeal until she talked to Ibn Az-Zubayr, and she freed forty slaves in expiation for her vow. Later, whenever she remembered this vow, she would weep profusely, wetting her veil.",

Abu Qatādah said: \"The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) also traveled until it was midnight. I was by his side. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) dozed off and leaned (to one side) of his camel. I went to him and lent him support without waking him up until he sat upright on his riding mount. He went on traveling until a major part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one side) of his camel. I supported him without waking him up until he sat on his ride. Then he traveled until it was near dawn. He (again) leaned, but far more, than the two earlier leanings, and he was about to fall down. So I went to him and supported him, and he lifted his head and said: 'Who is this?' I said: 'It is Abu Qātadah.' He (the Prophet again) said: 'How long have you been traveling along with me like this?' I said: 'I have been traveling in this very state since the night.' He said: 'May Allah guard you as you have guarded His Prophet.' He again said: 'Do you see that we are hidden from the people?' And again he said: 'Do you see anyone?' I said: 'Here is a rider.' I again said: 'Here is another rider,' until we gathered together and we were seven riders.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) stepped aside of the road and placed his head (for sleep and said): 'Guard our prayers for us.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) was the first to wake up, and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We got up startled. He (the Prophet) said: 'Ride on.' So we rode on until the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then dismounted and called for a jug of water which I had with me. There was a little water in it. He performed an ablution which was less thorough than his usual ablutions, and some water was left. The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said to Abu Qatādah: 'Keep for us your jug of water; it will have a miraculous affair.' Then Bilāl called (the people) to prayer, and then the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) observed two Rak‘ahs and then observed the morning prayer as he did every day. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) (then) rode on and we rode along with him, and some of us whispered to the others saying: 'How would there be compensation for the negligence we committed in our prayers?' Upon this, the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Is there not in me a model for you? There is no negligence in sleeping. The (cognizable) negligence is that one should not observe the prayer (intentionally) until the time of the next prayer comes. So the one who does this (leave a prayer on account of sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should observe the prayer when he becomes aware of it, and on the next day he should observe the prayer at its prescribed time.' Then he (the Prophet) said: 'What do you think the people would do (at this hour) when they would not find their Prophet with them in the morning. Abu Bakr and ‘Umar would say: ‘The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) must be behind you, he cannot leave you behind (him).’ Other people would say: ‘The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) is ahead of you.’ So if they obey Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, they would follow the right path.' So we proceeded on till we came up to the people (from whom we had lagged behind), and the day had considerably risen and everything became hot, and they (the Companions of the Prophet) said: 'O Messenger of Allah, we are dying of thirst.' Upon this, he (the Prophet) remarked: 'There is no destruction for you.' And he then said: 'Bring that small cup of mine.' And he then asked for the jug of water to be brought to him. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) poured water (in that small cup), and Abu Qatādah gave them water to drink. When the people saw that there was (a little) water in the jug, they gathered in crowds around it. Upon this, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Behave well; you will drink to your fill.' They complied. So the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) would fill (the cup), and I would serve them until no one was left except me and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). He then filled (the cup) with water and said to me: 'Drink it.' I said: 'Messenger of Allah, I will not drink until you drink.' Upon this, he said: 'The server of the people is the last among them to drink.' So I drank, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) also drank, and the people came to the place of water quite happy and satiated.\" ‘Abdullāh ibn Rabāh said: \"I was narrating this Hadīth in the grand mosque, when ‘Imrān ibn Husayn said: 'See, O young man, how will you narrate, for I was also one of the riders on that night.' I said: 'So you must know this Hadīth well.' He said: 'Who are you?' I said: 'I am one of the Ansār.' Upon this, he said: 'You narrate, for you know your Hadīths better.' I, therefore, narrated it to the people. Then ‘Imrān said: 'I was also present that night, but I do not know anyone who committed it to memory as well as you have.'\"",

He replied: 'Take a bath, bandage your private parts with a cloth, and assume Ihrām (ritual state of consecration).' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) then prayed (in the mosque) and mounted Al-Qaswā' (his she-camel), and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back. I saw (a large number of) people on mounts and on foot in front of him, and a similar number on his right side, and a similar number on his left side, and a similar number behind him. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) was among us, the Qur’an was being revealed to him, and he knew its interpretation. Whatever he did, we did it. \nThe Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) then raised his voice, declaring Allah’s unity and saying: 'Labbayk (I am at thy service), O Allah, Labbayk, Labbayk, You have no partner; praise and grace are Thine and the Dominion. You have no partner.' The people too raised their voices in Talbiyah, which they used to utter. But the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) did not comment on anything. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) continued his Talbiyah. We did not express our intention of performing anything but Hajj, being unaware of ‘Umrah (at that season), but when we came with him to the House (the Ka‘bah), he touched the corner (and made seven circuits), walking quickly with pride in three of them, and walking ordinarily in four. Then going forward to the station of Ibrahīm, he recited: {And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.}  [Sūrat al-Baqarah: 125] \n(While praying two Rak‘ahs, he kept the station between him and the House. (The narrator said: “My father said that Ibn Nufayl and ‘Uthmān said: ‘I do not know that he (Jābir) narrated it from anyone except the Prophet (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him).’” The narrator Sulaymān said: “I do not know, but he (Jābir) said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) used to recite in the two Rak‘ahs: {Say: He is Allah, one} [Sūrat al-Ikhlās] and: {Say: O infidels.} [Sūrat al-Kāfirūn].’”) \nHe then returned to the House (the Ka’bah) and touched the corner, after which he went out by the gate to As-Safa. When he reached near As-Safa, he recited: {As-Safa’ and Al-Marwah are among the indications of Allah.} [ Sūrat al Baqarah: 158] He added: 'We begin with what Allah began with.' He then began with As-Safa and ascending it till he could see the House, he declared the greatness of Allah and proclaimed his Unity. He then said: 'There is no god but Allah, Who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates.' He then supplicated in the course of that, saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards Al-Marwah, and when his feet reached the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend, he walked till he reached Al-Marwah. He did at Al-Marwah as he had done at As-Safa, and when he came to Al-Marwah for the last time, he said: 'If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding this matter of mine, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an ‘Umrah, so if any of you has no sacrificial animals, he may remove his Ihrām and treat it as an ‘Umrah.' All the people then removed their Ihrām and clipped their hair, except the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those who had brought sacrificial animals. Surāqah (ibn Mālik) ibn Ju‘sham then got up and asked the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him): 'Does this apply to the present year, or does it apply forever?' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) intertwined his fingers and said: 'The ‘Umrah has been incorporated in Hajj.' Adding: 'No, but forever and ever.'\n‘Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals of the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) and found Fātimah among one of those who had taken off their Ihrām. She said: 'Put on colored clothes;' and stained her eyes with collyrium. ‘Ali disliked (this action of her) and asked: 'Who commanded you to do this?' She said: 'My father.' ‘Ali said in Iraq: 'I went to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) to complain against Fātimah for what she had done and to ask for his opinion regarding what she had mentioned to me. I informed him that I disliked her action and that thereupon she said to me: 'My father commanded me to do this.' He said: 'She spoke the truth; she spoke the truth. What did you say when you put on Ihrām for Hajj?' ‘Ali said: 'O Allah, I put on Ihrām for the same purpose for which the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) has put it on.' He said: 'I have sacrificial animals with me, so do not take off Ihrām.'' The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) from Madīnah was one hundred. Then all the people except the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and those who had the sacrificial animals  with them took off Ihrām and clipped their hair. \nWhen the 8th of Dhu alHijjah came, they went towards Mina having put on Ihrām for Hajj, and the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) rode and prayed the Zhuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Ishā', and Fajr prayers at Mina. After that, he waited a little till the sun rose and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up at Namirah. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) then sent out, and the Quraysh did not doubt that he would halt at Al-Mash‘ar al-Haram at Al-Muzdalifah, as the Quraysh used to do in the pre-Islamic period, but he kept on till he came to ‘Arafah and found that the tent had been setup at Namirah. There he dismounted, and when the sun had passed the meridian, he ordered Al-Qaswā' to be brought, and when it was saddled for him, he went down to the bottom of the valley and addressed the people, saying: 'Your lives and your property are as sacred as this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. Lo! Everything pertaining to the pre-Islamic period has been put under my feet, and claims for blood vengeance belonging to the pre-Islamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood vengeance I permit is the blood vengeance of ours, that of the son of Rabī‘ah ibn al-Hārith. He was suckled among Banu Sa‘d and then killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of usury which I abolish is our usury, the usury of ‘Abbās ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. \nFear Allah regarding women, for you have got them under Allah’s security and have the right to intercourse with them by Allah’s word. It is a duty on them not to allow anyone whom you dislike to lie on your beds, so if they do, then beat them, but not severely. You are responsible for providing them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, if you hold on to it, you will never again go astray, that is Allah’s Book. You will be asked about me, so what will you say?' They replied: 'We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel.' Then he raised his forefinger towards the sky, and pointing it at the people, he said: 'O Allah, bear witness; O Allah, bear witness; O Allah, bear witness!'\nBilāl then uttered the call to prayer and the Iqāmah, and he prayed the Zhuhr prayer. He then uttered the Iqāmah, and he prayed the ‘Asr prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted Al-Qaswā' and came to the place of standing, making Al-Qaswā' turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and he faced the Qiblah. He remained standing till sunset and the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usāmah up behind him and severely picked the reins of Al-Qaswā', so much so that its head was touching the front part of the saddle. Pointing with its right hand, he was saying: 'Calmness, O People. Calmness, O people.' Whenever he ascended a mound (of sand), he let its reins a little loose so that it could ascend. He then came to Al-Muzdalifah, where he joined the Maghrib and the ‘Ishā' prayers, with one Adhān and two Iqāmahs. The narrator ‘Uthamān said He did not offer supererogatory prayers between them. The narrators are then agreed upon the version He then lay down till dawn and prayed the Fajr prayer when the morning light was clear. (The narrator, Sulaymān, said: “With one Adhān and one Iqāmah.”) \nHe then mounted Al-Qaswa’ and came to Al-Mash‘ar al-Harām and ascended it. He faced the Qiblah, praised Allah, and declared His greatness, His uniqueness, and His Unity and kept standing till the day was very clear. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) then quickly went before the sun rose and took Al-Fadl ibn ‘Abbās behind him on his camel. He was a man with beautiful hair, white and handsome. When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) quickly went, the women in the howdahs also began to quickly pass him. Al-Fadl looked at them. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) placed his hand on the face of Al-Fadl, but Al-Fadl turned his face towards the other side. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) also turned away his hand to the other side. Al-Fadl also turned his face to the other side, looking at them till he reached (the Valley of) Muhassir. He urged the camel a little and following a middle road which leads to Al-Jamrah al-Kubra, he came to the Jamrah (pillar) that is beside the tree and threw seven small pebbles at it, saying 'Allah is Most Great' each time he threw a pebble. He threw them from the bottom of the valley. \nThe Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) then went to the place of the sacrifice and sacrificed sixty-three camels with his own hand. He then let ‘Ali offer the remainder, so he shared his sacrificial animals with him. After that, he ordered that a piece of flesh from each camel should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. Afterwards, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him) quickly went to the House (the Ka‘bah) and prayed the Zhuhr prayer in Makkah. He then went to Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: 'Draw water, Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib! Were it not that people would take the right to draw water from you, I would draw it along with you.' So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it.’”",

He said: 'Bring her to me.' So I brought her to him, and he said to her: 'Where is Allah?' She said: 'He is in the heaven.' He said: 'Who am I?' She said: 'You are the Messenger of Allah.'

(After they had eaten) Abu Hurayrah said: \"Shall I tell you a tradition from your traditions, O you assembly of the Ansār?\" He gave an account of the Conquest of Makkah and said that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had proceeded until he reached Makkah. He dispatched Az-Zubayr on his right flank, Khālid on his left, and Abu ‘Ubaydah with a force that had no armor. They advanced to the interior of the valley.

The Quraysh also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: 'We will send these (men) forward. If they get anything, we will be with them (to share it) and if misfortune befalls them, we will pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for.' The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said (to the Ansār): 'You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraysh.' And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: 'Meet me at As-Safa.' Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted a certain person to be killed, he was killed, and none of them could offer any resistance.\"\nAbu Hurayrah continued: \"Then came Abu Sufyān and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraysh has become very cheap. There will be no Quraysh from this day on.' Then the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: 'Whoever enters the house of Abu Sufyān, he will be safe.' Some of the Ansār whispered among themselves: 'Love for his city and sympathy for his clan have overpowered him.' Abu Hurayrah said: \"A revelation came to the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) and when he was going to receive the revelation, we understood it, and when he was receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) until the revelation ended.

He reached an idol by the side of the Ka‘bah that was worshiped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) had a bow in his hand that he was holding from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow, saying: {The Truth has come, and falsehood has perished} [Sūrat al-Isrā': 81]. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to the Mount Safa, climbed it to a height from where he could see the Ka‘bah, raised his hands (in supplication), and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wished to pray.''",

By Allah, there was no religion more hateful to me than yours; but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful to me than yours; but now it is the most beloved city to me. Your cavalry arrested me when I was intending to perform ‘Umrah. And now what do you think?\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) gave him glad tidings and ordered him to go and perform ‘Umrah. So, when he went to Mecca, someone said to him: \"Have you apostatized?\" Thumāmah replied: \"No, by Allah! I have embraced Islam along with the Messenger of Allah. Behold, by Allah, no single grain of wheat will come to you from Yamāmah unless the Messenger of Allah gives his permission for it.\"",

So the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) set up a tent for him in the mosque in order to visit him from nearby. When the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) returned from the trench he placed his weapon down and washed up. Jibrīl (may peace be upon him) came to him while he was shaking the dust from his head and said: \"Have you laid down weapons? By Allah! I have not laid it down! Go out to them!\" The Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Where?\" So he pointed to Banu Qurayzhah. The Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) went to them and they surrendered. He turned the judgment over to Sa‘d, and Sa‘d said: \"I rule that their warriors be killed, their women and offspring be taken as captives, and that their wealth be divided.\" Hishām said: \"My father informed me that ‘Ā’ishah reported that Sa‘d said: 'O Allah, Indeed, You know that there is no one that I love to battle in Your cause than a people who belied and drove out Your Messenger (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him). O Allah, I think that You have ended the war between us and them, so if there remains any war against the Quraysh, then keep me alive so that I may battle them in Your cause; and if You have indeed ended the war, then let the blood flow and make my death therein.\" So his wound erupted from his throat. There was a tent in the mosque belonging to Banu Ghifār, and they were scared at the sight of blood flowing towards them. They said: \"O people of this tent, what is it that is coming to us from your side?\" And Sa‘d's wound continued to bleed, and he died from it (may Allah be pleased with him). [Al-Bukhāri]",
